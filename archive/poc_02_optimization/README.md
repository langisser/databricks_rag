- Advanced text chunking with overlap and semantic boundaries
- Metadata extraction and preservation
- Document hierarchy and structure awareness

**Optimized Vector Search:**
- Improved embedding strategies
- Better chunk size optimization
- Enhanced similarity search accuracy
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Production-Ready Features:**

## Implementation Status

**Branch**: `poc_iterative_02`
**Status**: Framework completed with manual setup instructions
**Real Data Source**: `/Volumes/sandbox/rdt_knowledge/rdt_document`

### Completed Components

✅ **Phase 1**: Real data ingestion framework (`phase1_real_data_ingestion.py`)
✅ **Phase 2**: Advanced chunking implementation (`phase2_advanced_chunking.py`)
✅ **Manual Setup**: Complete instructions for volume processing (`MANUAL_SETUP.md`)
✅ **Configuration**: Enhanced config with volume paths and chunking strategies

### Key Enhancements Over Iterative 1

**Real Document Processing:**
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, JSON)
- Volume-based file discovery and cataloging
- Enhanced metadata extraction and preservation

**Advanced Chunking:**
- Semantic boundary detection (sentence-based)
- Configurable overlap strategies
- Document-type-specific chunk sizing
- Improved semantic density calculations

**Production Features:**
- Batch processing capabilities
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Quality metrics and validation
- Structured metadata management

## Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Automated Processing (if volume accessible)
```bash
cd poc_iterative_02
python phase1_real_data_ingestion.py    # Process real documents
python phase2_advanced_chunking.py      # Create enhanced chunks
```

### Option 2: Manual Processing (recommended)
1. Follow instructions in `MANUAL_SETUP.md`
2. Copy the provided notebook code to Databricks UI
3. Process your real documents from `/Volumes/sandbox/rdt_knowledge/rdt_document`
4. Create enhanced vector search index with real data

## Expected Results

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `raw_documents_v2`: Real documents with rich metadata
- `rag_document_chunks_v2`: Advanced chunks with semantic boundaries

**Quality Improvements:**
- Better chunk boundary detection
- Configurable overlap strategies
- Document-type-specific processing
- Enhanced semantic analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Process Your Real Documents**: Use manual setup with your volume data
2. **Create Enhanced Vector Index**: Build new index with `rag_document_chunks_v2`
3. **Test with Real Queries**: Validate RAG with actual document content
4. **Deploy Production System**: Scale to full document collection

POC Iterative 2 provides the framework for processing your real documents with advanced chunking and enhanced quality for production RAG deployment.
